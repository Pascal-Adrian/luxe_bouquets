This artfully arranged bouquet offers vibrant shades of red and white, creating a contrasting and exquisite effect that breathes new life into any space. Its natural beauty is undeniable. This lovely arrangement is carefully nestled in a sleek and sophisticated white ceramic vase. Note: Because of the natural and hand-dyed nature of these stems, the colors may vary slightly from the ones pictured.",

        "Talk about all the best shades of purple in one place! The Naomi is the dried arrangement for anyone who can’t get enough of purple in everything. Sprigs of magenta, indigo, and fuchsia create a stunning spectrum of springtime colors. Meanwhile, pops of yellow dried flowers burst through from the background. With so many colors at play, a lovely white vase does the trick to tie everything together.",

        "Like the tracts of land throughout the English countryside, The Heath is a study in utter brilliance. When you aren’t riveted by the vision of earthy pampas grass that’s been dyed to crimson perfection, you’ll be entranced by the gilded vase. It’s modern-meets-avant-garden, a shapely and textural vision that beautifully complements the rich tone of the foliage.",
